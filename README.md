#  NN_MPC-vs-ANFIS_MPC


This is the implementation of the work published in the following paper "Optimized adaptive MPC for lateral control of autonomous vehicles".
The paper is freely accessible at this link: (https://hal.science/hal-03467943/file/ICNSC2021_YK_NAO_VV_DI_Neural_Network_and_ANFIS_based_autoadaptive_MPC_for_path_tracking_in_autonomous_vehicles.pdf) 

## Steps to run the code:

## This implementation requires MATLAB 2018b or a more recent version.

-  # NN_MPC:
   ## This part is an implementation of discrete MPC with neural network-based adaptive parameters (Np, Nc, Q, R, etc.)
   1. You can run the script 'Launch_NNMPC' to start.
   2. The script loads the parameters for the vehicle model and MPC controller (Params.mat).
   3. Simulation starts with the chosen parameters. You can try different trajectories and change the MPC parameters to compare its performance.
   4. Note that it is important to have all files in the main folder or added to the Matlab path.

-  # ANFIS_MPC:
   ## This part is an implementation of discrete MPC with ANFIS-based adaptive parameters (Np, Nc, Q, R, etc.)

   1. You can run the script 'Launch_ANFISMPC' to start.
   2. The script loads the parameters for the vehicle model and MPC controller (Params.mat).
   3. Simulation starts with the chosen parameters. You can try different trajectories and change the MPC parameters to compare its performance.
   4. Note that it is important to have all files in the main folder or added to the Matlab path.
   5. Note that the code might run slowly depending on your machine (this version has not yet been optimized to run fast)
